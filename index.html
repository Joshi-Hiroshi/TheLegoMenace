                These plastic bricks have had a major part to play in almost every kid's life. They are fun to play with , easy yet challenging to build and durable. But I ask you all , is there such a need for durability , that a plastic boat made in 1958 was found in the Arctic circle in 2017 ?

                2.16 million LEGO elements are moulded every hour. If stacked on top of one another, the pieces would form towers reaching all the way from the Earth to the Moon.They are manufactured at such magnitudes , that there are 62 bricks for every person on the planet. 
                With so many bricks manufactured , one can only imagine how many of those ended up in the sea.

    Scientists anaylsed LEGO samples washed up on the shore . These samples , with mild discolouration and fractures , turned out to be pieces from kits made in the 1970's and 80's. With increasing awareness and pressure on LEGO , it has decided that their products will be 100% sustainable by 2030.

    Facts and stuff

    Lego pieces take from 100 to 1300 years to biodegrade

    If stacked on top of one another, the pieces would form 10 towers reaching all the way from the Earth to the Moon.

    The company has made 400 billion LEGO elements or 62 bricks for every person on the planet.

    2.16 million LEGO elements are moulded every hour, or 36,000 per minute.

    A plastic boat was found in the Arctic circle in 2017â€”it was a free toy from a cereal packet in 1958.

    at least 90 percent of toys are plastic and every plastic toy ever bought still exists in one form or other.  Plastic usually does not biodegrade but instead photodegrades into microplastics over time.
